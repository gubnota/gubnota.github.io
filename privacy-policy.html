				<h2>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h2>
				<p>
					For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you,
					like your name or email address.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any information that falls outside of this is “non-personal
					information.”
				</p>
				<p>
					If we store your personal information with information that is
					non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal
					information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data
					then the remaining is non-personal information.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="how-do-we-learn-information-about-you">
				<h2>How do we learn information about you?</h2>
				<p>We learn information about you when:</p>
				<ul class="fwn-u-list-styled">
					<li>
						you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash
						reports);
					</li>
					<li>
						we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g.,
						when your browser / device checks with us to see if the data is
						relevant out there);
					</li>
					<li>
						someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when your app /
						device works with your local Internet providers they can collect
						your personal information); or
					</li>
					<li>
						when we try and understand more about you based on information
						you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize
						language for some of our services).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="when-do-we-share-your-information-with-others">
				<h2>When do we share your information with others?</h2>
				<ul class="fwn-u-list-styled">
					<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>
					<li>
						For processing or providing products and services to you, but only
						if those entities receiving your information are contractually
						obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Fenki.net
					</li>
					<li>
						When the law requires it: e.g. there is a request about you from a
						government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're
						asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless
						we're legally prohibited from doing so. Nothing in this policy is
						intended to limit any objections or legal defenses that you may have
						to a 3rd party's request to disclose your information.
					</li>
					<li>
						If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a
						restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your
						information to a successor or affiliate.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="what-do-we-do-with-your-information-once-we-have-it">
				<h2>What do we do with your information once we have it?</h2>
				<p>
					When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which
					you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help
					us provide and improve our products and services for you.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="how-do-we-store-and-protect-your-personal-information">
				<h2>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h2>
				<p>
					We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have
					it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures.
					Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify
					you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we
					need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for
					(usually, 90 days). Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it
					unless we are required by law to keep it longer.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="what-else-should-you-know">
				<h2>What else should you know?</h2>
				<p>
					We're a global organization and our computers are in several different
					places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers
					may also be in various countries. This means that your information
					might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that
					country may have a different level of data protection regulation than
					yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer
					of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we
					comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we
					make in this privacy policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you
					must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your
					child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information,
					please contact us to have your child's information removed.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="family-policy">
				<h2>Family policy and your child’s activity</h2>
				<p>
					We do not collect any information about your child’s activity in our
					services and we do not make our apps specially appealing to children.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section
				id="what-if-we-change-this-privacy-policy-or-any-of-our-privacy-notices"
			>
				<h2>
					What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
				</h2>
				<p>
					We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be
					posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the
					update through Fenki.net's usual channels for such announcements such
					as an announcement on our website. Your continued use of the product
					or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your
					acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we
					will post an effective date at the top of the page.
